# Httper
This is a simple HTTP request maker tool with a UI to make it easier to make API requests with payloads etc...

Httper builds and runs on Linux, OS X and Windows as long as you have a fairly C++11 compatible compiler and QT 5.X.

# How to build
Clone the repository

Make a new folder named build, execute qmake and then make.

$ mkdir build

$ cd build

$ qmake ../Httper.pro

$ make


If the above succeeds you should be able to find a bin/Release folder containing you're newly built binaries.
